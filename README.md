# Analysis-of-Sales-Report-of-a-Clothes-Manufacturing-Outlet

Background and Objective:

A high-end fashion retail store is looking to expand its products. It wants to understand the market and find the current trends in the industry. It has a database of all products with attributes, such as style, material, season, and the sales of the products over a period of two months.

Domain: Retail

Analysis Tasks:

The goals of this project are:

..>To automate the process of recommendations, the store needs to analyze the given attributes of the product, like the style, season, etc., and come up with a model to predict the recommendation of products (in binary output â€“ 0 or 1) accordingly.

..>In order to stock the inventory, the store wants to analyze the sales data and predict the trend of total sales for each dress for an extended period of three more alternative days.

..>To decide the pricing for various upcoming clothes, they wish to find how the style, season, and material affect the sales of a dress and if the style of the dress is more influential than its price.

..>Also, to increase sales, the management wants to analyze the attributes of dresses and find which are the leading factors affecting the sale of a dress.

..>To regularize the rating procedure and find its efficiency, the store wants to find if the rating of the dress affects the total sales

Source of the dataset:-

The data is obtained fom UCI Machine Learning Repository.The dataset can be downloaded from here This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

Structure of the data:-

Our data contains the following variables with the corresponding descriptions:

InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.

StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.

Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.

Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.

InvoiceDate: Invice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.

UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.

CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.

Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

Aim of the study:-

In this project, we first clean the data, treat missing data and prepare the data for further analysis.Next we explore interesting patterns in the the data using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) techniques.This includes answering interesting questions like which products are the most popular products, which country saw the maximum sales, as well as in which weekday sales is maximum.Finally we conduct a Market Basket Analysis to find out which products are frequently bought together, so that relevant product recommendations can be provided to a customer who is interested in buying a particular item.

Installing / Getting started

The analysis was conducted using R.

Minimal setup required:

R

R Studio

Also apart from the R core packages, some other packages are also required for running the analysis.PLease open up the R Studio and run the following commands.The required libraries for this analysis will be installed if required and will be loaded for the current session.

if (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages('tidyverse')

if (!require(arules)) install.packages('arules')

if (!require(arulesViz)) install.packages('arulesViz')

Flow of the project:-

The codes of the project are shown as script.R file in a project pipeline format which can be run one after the other to get an idea of the flow of the analysis.

The script data cleaning shows the basic cleaning and preparation of the raw data for the further analysis steps. The next script EDA unveils the interesting facts of the data using exploratory data analysis techniques. Finally market basket analysis is conducted to identify the products that often co-occur in transactions.
